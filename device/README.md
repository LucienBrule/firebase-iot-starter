##Known issues:

- firebase auth tokens expire -> fix = refresh the auth token maybe.

##Stuff to do
- read four sensors
- hook up stuff for status leds
- determine where an object was placed given deltas
- report that to firebase
- send a notification when a thing was placed on the baord
- enter into a receive state when you receive a message from firebase
